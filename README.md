# Team Tailor Task:
### Create a simple application that uses an open API to fetch data from
### Include a control that triggers new calls to the API to change the displayed data
### Include installation and short test instructions in the readme
### Share the code on GitHub or any repository and share the link with us (if you prefer a private repo, just let us know and you can invite some of us)
